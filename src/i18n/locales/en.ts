    questions: [
      {
        question: 'Is the bot detectable?',
        answer: 'Yes, the bot is detectable. However, there are techniques to reduce detection risk such as moving the controller during engagements or manually taking control of the bot to avoid repetitive and identical movements. For bots like Nexto or Nexto Immortal, we recommend using Auto-Legend which allows running a second instance of Rocket League on the same PC.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What rank can Toramibot achieve?',
        answer: 'Toramibot can reach:\n- GC2 in 2v2\n- SSL in Snowday\n- Champion 2/Champion 3 in 1v1\n- Champion 1/Champion 2 in 3v3\nThese ranks are based on a one-week testing period, except for Snowday which was tested over three weeks.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Does the bot work in all game modes?',
        answer: 'No, the bot does not work in all modes. It does not work in Super Bowl, Rumble, Volleyball, and event modes. However, it works in standard modes, including Snowday and Hoops (with some difficulties in Hoops).'
      },
      {
        question: 'Which bot is best for running multiple instances?',
        answer: 'The best bots for multiple instances are Nexto and Nexto Immortal. They are the most efficient for this use. However, the best bot provided on our server remains Toramibot.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Does the bot perform mechanics?',
        answer: 'The bot is not proficient in aerial mechanics and often makes poor touches in the air. However, on the ground, it is extremely effective, executing flicks and ball control almost perfectly. For aerial mechanics, Nexto Immortal is recommended.'
